# Feroniapi

Feroniapi is a redesign by Julienne Richard (https://www.instagram.com/julienne__richard/) of Peter Wiegel's Feronia font (https://www.peter-wiegel.de/Feronia.html). Fork's work began as part of the design of the visual identity for the Palais des Fêtes, an iconic dance venue showcasing Strasbourg's Art Nouveau architecture. The main inspirations are Art Nouveau curves and popular dances. The design strives for simplicity and accessibility. The artwork is smoothed and enhanced with useful features such as a set of post-binary ligatures (thanks to the QUNI from Bye Bye Binary); vowel variations; Art Nouveau-style frieze patterns; and a set of fruits and vegetables dingbats. Enjoy!
